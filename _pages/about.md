I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/).
Previously, I was a PhD student
under the supervision of [Niels Richard Hansen](https://nrhstat.org/) :sunglasses:

My research interests are in mathematical statistics and machine learning, with a focus on model-free statistical methods. My PhD work centered on statistical inference for conditional association measures in complex data settings, including unstructured covariates and counting processes.

*Keywords*: nonparametric statistics, model-free methods, covariate adjustment, local independence, double/debiased machine learning, continuous-time stochastic processes.
