How do you detect if a process influences another process after having adjusted for confounding? In our new work, __*Nonparametric Conditional Local Independence Testing*__, we solve this problem nonparametrically for the first time! Combining techniques from double machine learning and stochastic processes, we are able to show a new functional central limit theorem. This allows us to construct nonparametric tests in a general framework :muscle:
