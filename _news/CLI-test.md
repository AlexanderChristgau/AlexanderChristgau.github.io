How do you detect if a process influences another process after having adjusted for confounding? In our new work, __*Nonparametric Conditional Local Independence Testing*__, we solve this problem nonparametrically for the first time! Combining techniques from double machine learning and stochastic processes, we are able to show a new functional central limit theorem. From this we construct a nonparametric test in a general framework.
