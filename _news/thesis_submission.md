I submitted my PhD Thesis! :tada:

It is [publicly available](https://noter.math.ku.dk/phd24amc.pdf).
In addition to the already published and arXived papers, the thesis contains a new manuscript titled *Assumption-lean Aalen regression*, along with a brief introductory chapter.

I will be continuing as a postdoc to complete projects from my PhD studies.
