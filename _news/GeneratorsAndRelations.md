In our new work, __*On Generators and Relations of the Rational Cohomology of Hilbert Schemes*__, we study an abstract algebra deeply related to the celebrated *moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces*. The paper is the final outcome of a course in *Experimental Mathematics*. As such, it is a prime example of how experiments and computers can aid research in pure and abstract mathematics.
